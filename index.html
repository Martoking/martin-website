    <section class="Home">
        <p>I am Obondi Martine, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Rongo University, located in Migori, Kenya. I am in my third year of studies, passionate about programming, software development, and the limitless possibilities offered by technology.</p>
        <p>My journey into the world of computer science began with a fascination for how software and systems work together to solve real-world problems efficiently. Over the years, I have honed my skills in various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.</p>
        <p>Outside of academics, I actively participate in coding competitions and hackathons, where I collaborate with like-minded individuals to create innovative solutions. These experiences have enriched my problem-solving abilities and enhanced my understanding of software development methodologies.</p>
        <p>My goal is to become a proficient full stack developer, capable of designing and implementing scalable web applications that make a positive impact. I am particularly interested in frontend technologies like React.js and backend frameworks like Node.js, aiming to create seamless user experiences through intuitive interfaces and robust functionalities.</p>
        <p>At Rongo University, I am involved in student organizations focused on technology and innovation, where I contribute to projects that promote technological literacy and practical application of computer science concepts.</p>
        <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy exploring new technologies, attending tech meetups, and continuously learning through online courses and tutorials. I believe in the power of lifelong learning and staying updated with industry trends to remain competitive in the ever-evolving field of technology.</p>
        <p>As I progress in my academic journey and gain hands-on experience through internships and personal projects, I look forward to leveraging my skills and knowledge to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry and make a difference in the world.</p>
