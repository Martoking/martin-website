        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> <p>I am Obondi Martine, a dedicated and passionate third-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Rongo University, located in Migori, Kenya. My journey into the world of technology began with a deep curiosity about how software and systems work together to solve real-world problems.</p>
        <p>From an early age, I was drawn to computers and fascinated by their potential to transform industries and improve lives. This passion led me to pursue higher education in computer science, where I have gained foundational knowledge in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.</p>
        <p>Throughout my academic career, I have consistently demonstrated a strong aptitude for logical thinking and problem-solving. I thrive in environments that challenge me to apply theoretical concepts to practical scenarios, whether through coursework, projects, or extracurricular activities.</p>
        <p>Outside of the classroom, I actively participate in coding competitions, hackathons, and collaborative projects with fellow students. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical skills but also sharpened my ability to work effectively in teams and under tight deadlines.</p>
        <p>At Rongo University, I am a proactive member of Google developers student club focused on technology and innovation. I contribute to initiatives that promote technological literacy and encourage the practical application of computer science principles among my peers.</p>
        <p>My academic journey has been complemented by internships and practical training experiences, where I have had the opportunity to apply my skills in real-world settings. These experiences have provided me with valuable insights into industry practices and reinforced my commitment to pursuing a career in technology.</p>
        <p>My ultimate goal is to become a proficient full stack developer, capable of designing and implementing robust and scalable web applications. I am particularly interested in frontend technologies like React.js for building intuitive user interfaces, as well as backend frameworks such as Node.js for developing efficient server-side applications.</p>
        <p>I am driven by a passion for innovation and a desire to make a meaningful impact through technology. I believe in the power of software to streamline processes, enhance communication, and create new opportunities for individuals and businesses alike.</p>
        <p>Continuous learning is at the core of my professional development. I actively seek out opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills, whether through online courses, workshops, or self-directed projects. Staying updated with the latest trends and advancements in technology allows me to adapt quickly to industry changes and maintain a competitive edge.</p>
        <p>Aside from technical skills, I value creativity, attention to detail, and a collaborative mindset in my work. I enjoy tackling complex problems and exploring innovative solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible in software development.</p>
        <p>In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I am passionate about giving back to the community. I volunteer my time and skills to initiatives that promote digital literacy and support underrepresented groups in technology.</p>
        <p>Outside of technology, I have diverse interests including reading, hiking, and exploring new cultures. These hobbies provide me with a well-rounded perspective and inspire creativity in my approach to both personal and professional challenges.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in learning more about my experiences, discussing potential collaborations, or simply want to connect, please feel free to reach out. I am always open to meaningful conversations and opportunities to learn from others in the tech community.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website. I look forward to connecting with you!</p></p>
